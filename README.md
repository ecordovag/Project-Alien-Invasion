# 13-5. Sideways Shooter Part 2: 

We’ve come a long way since Exercise 12-6, Sideways Shooter. For this exercise, try to develop Sideways Shooter to the same point we’ve brought Alien Invasion to. Add a fleet of aliens, and make them move sideways toward the ship. Or, write code that places aliens at random positions along the right side of the screen and then sends them toward the ship. Also, write code that makes the aliens disappear when they’re hit.
