# Exercise 12-6. Sideways Shooter: 

Write a game that places a ship on the left side of the screen and allows the player to move the ship up and down. 

Make the ship fire a bullet that travels right across the screen when the player presses the spacebar.

Make sure bullets are deleted once they disappear off the screen.
